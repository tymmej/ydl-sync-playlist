# ydl-sync-playlist

Download and sync any YouTube playlist using youtube-dl.

What does sync mean? It downloads new videos added to playlist and deletes from disk videos which are not in playlist.

Use case:
Use it with watch later playlist. Add script to cron and new videos are waiting for you on your disk! After watching video simply delete it from playlist - during next sync it will disappear from your disk too!
